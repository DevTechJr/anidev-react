AnirudhBV.JS - my custom portfolio page.

Live Project Link ‚ñ∂Ô∏è :

## Description

Hey, it's Anirudh.

I recently created my long-delayed portfolio website, AnirudhBV.JS. It's a multipage React.JS based website created with KitWind's UI kit, Daisy UI and Tailwind CSS throughout my website. I've also installed various npm packages to create dynamic components including a responsive auto-play carousel and typewriter effect found in the site's CTA. I also used GitHub's REST API to dynamically display information about my GitHub account throughout my website. The message feature found on the portfolio works as well using EmailJS, an online based email web service.

Note : This page is responsive and looks good on all screen sizes. Don't hesitate to change screen width or view on another device- it'll look just as good!

Below is more information about the tools and technologies used to construct this portfolio page :
